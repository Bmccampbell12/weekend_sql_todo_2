# weekend-sql-to-do-list



## This App allows the user to create a to-do item. Once a to-do item is created it is stored inside a database table. Each to-do item has a button to 'Complete' or 'Delete' it once generated.

This application resolves the issue of needing to rememeber various tasks by documenting them as the user enters them into the text field, thus adding the to-do tasks to the database where it can be retrieved or deleted with the press of a button, at any time.
